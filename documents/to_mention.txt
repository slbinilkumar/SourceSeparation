- Best train loss:
    - conv1 1x10x2205, conv2 10x1x1: 
        - 40 at 180 steps
        - 35 at 250 steps 
    - conv1 1x10x2205, relu, conv2 10x1x1: 
        - 40 at 150 steps
        - 35 at 400 steps 
        - 30 at 1200 steps
    - conv1 1x10x551, relu, gru1 10x3x1, relu, conv2 3x1x1: 
        - 41 at 230 steps
        
        
- Embeddings
- Ablation study:
    - Chunk discard vs no chunk discard
    - MSE vs spectrogram loss
    - Constraint on the waveform sum
    
- Why source separation:
    - Intuitively, deep learning is good for tasks that humans are good at without consciously thinking.
    - We can generate crazy images with GANs
    - We can generate speech that is better than human
    - We can upscale images
    - But we can't separate instruments in a song??? Humans can more or less do it
